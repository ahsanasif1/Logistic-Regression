    "## Assessment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, you need to demonstrate your skills for applying regularized logistic regression to perform two-class and multi-class classification for real-world tasks. You also need to demonstrate your skill in recognizing under-fitting/overfitting situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part-1 (Binary Classification):\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we will use a subset of [Wisconsin Breast cancer dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic). Note that this dataset has some information missing. \n",

    "**1.1 Data Munging (3 Marks)** \n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning the data is essential when dealing with real world problems. Training and testing data is stored in \"data/wisconsin_data\" folder. You have to perform the following:\n",
    "- Read the training and testing data. Print the number of features in the dataset. **(0.5 marks)**\n",
    "- For the data label, print the total number of B's and M's in the training and testing data. Comment on the class distribution. Is it balanced or unbalanced? **(0.5 marks)**\n",
    "- Print the number of features with missing entries (feature value is zero). **(0.5 marks)**\n",
    "- Fill the missing entries. For filling any feature, you can use either mean or median value of the feature values from observed entries. Explain the reason behind your choice. **(1.0 marks)**\n",
    "- Normalize the training and testing data. **(0.5 marks)**\n",

    "**1.2 Logistic Regression (5 Marks) ** \n",
    "Train logistic regression models with L1 regularization and L2 regularization using alpha = 0.1 and lambda = 0.1. Report accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and print the confusion matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "B- For L2 model, choose the best lambda value from the following set: {0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1,0.3,1,3,10,33} based on parameter P. **(2 Marks)**\n",

    "- *Use these 10 sets of data to find the average validation performance P.*\n",

    "- *Performance is defined as: P='accuracy' if fID=0, P='f1-score' if fID=1, P='precision' if fID=2. Calculate fID using modulus operation fID=SID % 3, where SID is your student ID. For example, if your student ID is 356288 then fID=(356288 % 3)=2 then use 'precision' for selecting the best value of alpha/lambda.]*\n",

    "For this experiment, we will use a small subset of [MNIST dataset for handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This dataset has no missing data. You will have to implement one-versus-rest scheme to perform multi-class classification using a binary classifier based on L1 regularized logistic regression. \n",

On a graph, plot both the average training performance (in red) and average validation performacne (in blue) w.r.t. each hyperparameter value.
